<p>The PlayedOn relation is the relation between the Platform and Games entities. Each Platform can play many games, however the original game can only be played on one platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>GameName and PlatformName would be the two keys for this relation</li>

<h2 id="gameappearance">GameAppearance</h2>
<p>The GameAppearance relation is the relation between the Games and PokemonAppearance entities. Each game can have only one pokemon appearance, however pokemon appear in multiple games.</p>
<ul>
<li>GameName and AppearanceId would be the two keys for this relation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appearancecanlearn">AppearanceCanLearn</h2>

<ul>
<li>AppearanceId and LearnAtLevel would be the two keys for this relation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="canlearnattacks">CanLearnAttacks</h2>
<p>The CanLearnAttacks relation is the relation between the PokemonCanLearn and Attacks entities. Each level can have multiple attacks available at it, however individual attacks always are learnable at the same level.</p>
<ul>
<li>LearnAtLevel and AttackName would be the two keys for this relation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typeofattack">TypeOfAttack</h2>
<p>The TypeOfAttack relation is the relation between the Attacks and AttackTypes entities. Each attack has only one type, however multiple attacks are classified as each type.</p>
<ul>
<li>AttackName would be the key for the relation as AttackTypes references a foreign key</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typeof">TypeOf</h2>
<p>The TypeOf relation is the relation between the Types and AttackTypes entities. Each type has only one attack type as it corresponds directly with the entity, however attack types can have multiple types.</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeName would be the key for the relation as AttackTypes references a foreign key</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typematch">TypeMatch</h2>
<p>The Typematch relation is the relation between the Types and TypeMatchups entities. Each type has two matchups, either against itself, or against another. The matchup however can work against multiple different types.</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeEffectivenessMultiplier and Type Name are the two keys for this relation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pokemonapp">PokemonApp</h2>
<p>The PokemonApp relation is the relation between the Pokemon and PokemonAppearance entities. Each Pokemon has one appearance per game, however each appearance can have multiple Pokemon.</p>
<ul>
<li>AppearanceID and PokemonID are the two keys for this relation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="evolvesto">EvolvesTo</h2>
<p>The EvolvesTo relation is the relation between the Pokemon and PokemonEvolutions entities. Each Pokemon has two states, its current form and its evolved form. Many Pokemon have evolutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>PokemonID would be the key for the relation as PokemonEvolutions references a foreign key.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pokemonhasmedia">PokemonHasMedia</h2>
<p>The PokemonHasMedia relation is the relation between the Pokemon and Media entities. Each Pokemon would have only one media file, while there are multiple Pokemon to have media for.</p>
<ul>
<li>MediaID and PokemonId would be the two keys for this relation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="filetype">FileType</h2>
<p>The FileType relation is the relation between the Media and MIMEType entities. Each Media file would contain multiple different MIME formats, and MIME types would be used by multiple different media files.</p>
<ul>
<li>MIMEText and Media ID would be the two keys for this relation</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="information-that-could-be-extracted">Information That Could Be Extracted</h1>
<p>We expect the user to be able to extract any relevant information about the Pokémon available on a platform. For example, the user could find out the number of Pokémon games available on a console, or what Pokémon are available on a console. The user could quire a Pokémon on the Gameboy and find out what moves it can use, and at which level it can learn them. They could also extract what that Pokémon's base stats are. Using the Media entity, the user could also see if any media files are available for said Pokémon. The user could go so far as to find which move types are advantageous against others. The user could also find the differences in a Pokémon's evolution between titles</p>
<h1 id="updates-to-the-database">Updates to the Database</h1>
<p>A new game would cause many additions to the database, with nearly every entity receiving new entries. This is because Pokémon from previous titles are often brought over into new titles. This would mean that all of the entities would receive those duplicate Pokémon, with possible updates to their stats and moves. The Media and MIMEType entities are less likely to see an immediate update as they require people to create media for the new Pokémon. The Media and MIMEType could also be modified but changes to these entities would not create changes in the rest of the database.</p>
